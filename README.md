Build a Cookie Clicker Game

# Required:

Have a look at the live demo of the game and see if you can come up with another story. There's something the app does that isn't quite so obvious. Hint: Close the tab or refresh the page. See how it remembers the number?

🎯 Style the button. Draw a cookie, use stock assets, or use a giant emoji! 🍪

🎯 Add an event listener to the button to increment a cookie counter variable.

🏹 Add a CSS animation of some kind when you click the button

🏹 Add some more styling to the game to make it look more like the original, or your own design. Use CSS animations to make the cookie bounce when you click it, or add a background image.

🏹 Add more interesting upgrades to the game that have different effects on cookie production. Maybe you need a certain amount of grandmas to operate a certain amount of cookie ovens. Add a new section to the page to display the upgrades. Add a new upgrade that increases the cookie click value.

# Recap

- The user should be able to click on a cookie image/button to increase their cookie counter.
- The cookie counter should go up by an amount (1 by default) per second.
- The users progress in the game (cookie count and upgrades purchased) should be stored in local storage.
- The user should be able to purchase upgrades. These upgrades should be fetched from the cookie API provided.
- The upgrades purchased should effect the cookies per second earned.
